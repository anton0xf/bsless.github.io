# `(source bsless)`

Ben Sless.

Currently working in [Appsflyer](https://twitter.com/AppsFlyerDev) as a
backend developer, and developing open source Clojure libraries which I
hope people will find useful.

# `(doc bsless)`

I used to be an electrical engineer, but a chance encounter with SICP
and some Linux hacking put me on an unavoidable path towards software engineering.

I'm interested in writing scalable efficient programs, software
craftsmanship, and Lisp (if that wasn't obvious).
